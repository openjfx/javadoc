<div class="block">Base class for scene graph nodes. A scene graph is a set of tree data structures
 where every item has zero or one parent, and each item is either
 a "leaf" with zero sub-items or a "branch" with zero or more sub-items.
 <p>
 Each item in the scene graph is called a <code>Node</code>. Branch nodes are
 of type <a href="Parent.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Parent</code></a>, whose concrete subclasses are <a href="Group.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Group</code></a>,
 <a href="layout/Region.html" title="class in javafx.scene.layout"><code>Region</code></a>, and <a href="../../../javafx.controls/javafx/scene/control/Control.html" title="class in javafx.scene.control"><code>Control</code></a>,
 or subclasses thereof.
 <p>
 Leaf nodes are classes such as
 <a href="shape/Rectangle.html" title="class in javafx.scene.shape"><code>Rectangle</code></a>, <a href="text/Text.html" title="class in javafx.scene.text"><code>Text</code></a>,
 <a href="image/ImageView.html" title="class in javafx.scene.image"><code>ImageView</code></a>, <a href="../../../javafx.media/javafx/scene/media/MediaView.html" title="class in javafx.scene.media"><code>MediaView</code></a>,
 or other such leaf classes which cannot have children. Only a single node within
 each scene graph tree will have no parent, which is referred to as the "root" node.
 <p>
 There may be several trees in the scene graph. Some trees may be part of
 a <a href="Scene.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Scene</code></a>, in which case they are eligible to be displayed.
 Other trees might not be part of any <a href="Scene.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Scene</code></a>.
 <p>
 A node may occur at most once anywhere in the scene graph. Specifically,
 a node must appear no more than once in all of the following:
 as the root node of a <a href="Scene.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Scene</code></a>,
 the children ObservableList of a <a href="Parent.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Parent</code></a>,
 or as the clip of a <a href="Node.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Node</code></a>.
 <p>
 The scene graph must not have cycles. A cycle would exist if a node is
 an ancestor of itself in the tree, considering the <a href="Group.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Group</code></a> content
 ObservableList, <a href="Parent.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Parent</code></a> children ObservableList, and <a href="Node.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Node</code></a> clip relationships
 mentioned above.
 <p>
 If a program adds a child node to a Parent (including Group, Region, etc)
 and that node is already a child of a different Parent or the root of a Scene,
 the node is automatically (and silently) removed from its former parent.
 If a program attempts to modify the scene graph in any other way that violates
 the above rules, an exception is thrown, the modification attempt is ignored
 and the scene graph is restored to its previous state.
 <p>
 It is possible to rearrange the structure of the scene graph, for
 example, to move a subtree from one location in the scene graph to
 another. In order to do this, one would normally remove the subtree from
 its old location before inserting it at the new location. However, the
 subtree will be automatically removed as described above if the application
 doesn't explicitly remove it.
 <p>
 Node objects may be constructed and modified on any thread as long they are
 not yet attached to a <a href="Scene.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Scene</code></a> in a <a href="../stage/Window.html" title="class in javafx.stage"><code>Window</code></a> that is
 <a href="../stage/Window.html#isShowing()"><code>showing</code></a>.
 An application must attach nodes to such a Scene or modify them on the JavaFX
 Application Thread.

 <p>
 The JavaFX Application Thread is created as part of the startup process for
 the JavaFX runtime. See the <a href="../application/Application.html" title="class in javafx.application"><code>Application</code></a> class and
 the <a href="../application/Platform.html#startup(java.lang.Runnable)"><code>Platform.startup(Runnable)</code></a> method for more information.
 </p>

 <p>
 An application should not extend the Node class directly. Doing so may lead to
 an UnsupportedOperationException being thrown.
 </p>

 <h3>String ID</h3>
 <p>
 Each node in the scene graph can be given a unique <a href="#idProperty()"><code>id</code></a>. This id is
 much like the "id" attribute of an HTML tag in that it is up to the designer
 and developer to ensure that the <code>id</code> is unique within the scene graph.
 A convenience function called <a href="#lookup(java.lang.String)"><code>lookup(String)</code></a> can be used to find
 a node with a unique id within the scene graph, or within a subtree of the
 scene graph. The id can also be used identify nodes for applying styles; see
 the CSS section below.

 <h3>Coordinate System</h3>
 <p>
 The <code>Node</code> class defines a traditional computer graphics "local"
 coordinate system in which the <code>x</code> axis increases to the right and the
 <code>y</code> axis increases downwards.  The concrete node classes for shapes
 provide variables for defining the geometry and location of the shape
 within this local coordinate space.  For example,
 <a href="shape/Rectangle.html" title="class in javafx.scene.shape"><code>Rectangle</code></a> provides <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>,
 <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> variables while
 <a href="shape/Circle.html" title="class in javafx.scene.shape"><code>Circle</code></a> provides <code>centerX</code>, <code>centerY</code>,
 and <code>radius</code>.
 <p>
 At the device pixel level, integer coordinates map onto the corners and
 cracks between the pixels and the centers of the pixels appear at the
 midpoints between integer pixel locations.  Because all coordinate values
 are specified with floating point numbers, coordinates can precisely
 point to these corners (when the floating point values have exact integer
 values) or to any location on the pixel.  For example, a coordinate of
 <code>(0.5, 0.5)</code> would point to the center of the upper left pixel on the
 <code>Stage</code>.  Similarly, a rectangle at <code>(0, 0)</code> with dimensions
 of <code>10</code> by <code>10</code> would span from the upper left corner of the
 upper left pixel on the <code>Stage</code> to the lower right corner of the
 10th pixel on the 10th scanline.  The pixel center of the last pixel
 inside that rectangle would be at the coordinates <code>(9.5, 9.5)</code>.
 <p>
 In practice, most nodes have transformations applied to their coordinate
 system as mentioned below.  As a result, the information above describing
 the alignment of device coordinates to the pixel grid is relative to
 the transformed coordinates, not the local coordinates of the nodes.
 The <a href="shape/Shape.html" title="class in javafx.scene.shape"><code>Shape</code></a> class describes some additional
 important context-specific information about coordinate mapping and how
 it can affect rendering.

 <h3>Transformations</h3>
 <p>
 Any <code>Node</code> can have transformations applied to it. These include
 translation, rotation, scaling, or shearing.
 <p>
 A <b>translation</b> transformation is one which shifts the origin of the
 node's coordinate space along either the x or y axis. For example, if you
 create a <a href="shape/Rectangle.html" title="class in javafx.scene.shape"><code>Rectangle</code></a> which is drawn at the origin
 (x=0, y=0) and has a width of 100 and a height of 50, and then apply a
 <a href="transform/Translate.html" title="class in javafx.scene.transform"><code>Translate</code></a> with a shift of 10 along the x axis
 (x=10), then the rectangle will appear drawn at (x=10, y=0) and remain
 100 points wide and 50 tall. Note that the origin was shifted, not the
 <code>x</code> variable of the rectangle.
 <p>
 A common node transform is a translation by an integer distance, most often
 used to lay out nodes on the stage.  Such integer translations maintain the
 device pixel mapping so that local coordinates that are integers still
 map to the cracks between pixels.
 <p>
 A <b>rotation</b> transformation is one which rotates the coordinate space of
 the node about a specified "pivot" point, causing the node to appear rotated.
 For example, if you create a <a href="shape/Rectangle.html" title="class in javafx.scene.shape"><code>Rectangle</code></a> which is
 drawn at the origin (x=0, y=0) and has a width of 100 and height of 30 and
 you apply a <a href="transform/Rotate.html" title="class in javafx.scene.transform"><code>Rotate</code></a> with a 90 degree rotation
 (angle=90) and a pivot at the origin (pivotX=0, pivotY=0), then
 the rectangle will be drawn as if its x and y were zero but its height was
 100 and its width -30. That is, it is as if a pin is being stuck at the top
 left corner and the rectangle is rotating 90 degrees clockwise around that
 pin. If the pivot point is instead placed in the center of the rectangle
 (at point x=50, y=15) then the rectangle will instead appear to rotate about
 its center.
 <p>
 Note that as with all transformations, the x, y, width, and height variables
 of the rectangle (which remain relative to the local coordinate space) have
 not changed, but rather the transformation alters the entire coordinate space
 of the rectangle.
 <p>
 A <b>scaling</b> transformation causes a node to either appear larger or
 smaller depending on the scaling factor. Scaling alters the coordinate space
 of the node such that each unit of distance along the axis in local
 coordinates is multiplied by the scale factor. As with rotation
 transformations, scaling transformations are applied about a "pivot" point.
 You can think of this as the point in the Node around which you "zoom".  For
 example, if you create a <a href="shape/Rectangle.html" title="class in javafx.scene.shape"><code>Rectangle</code></a> with a
 <code>strokeWidth</code> of 5, and a width and height of 50, and you apply a
 <a href="transform/Scale.html" title="class in javafx.scene.transform"><code>Scale</code></a> with scale factors (x=2.0, y=2.0) and
 a pivot at the origin (pivotX=0, pivotY=0), the entire rectangle
 (including the stroke) will double in size, growing to the right and
 downwards from the origin.
 <p>
 A <b>shearing</b> transformation, sometimes called a skew, effectively
 rotates one axis so that the x and y axes are no longer perpendicular.
 <p>
 Multiple transformations may be applied to a node by specifying an ordered
 chain of transforms.  The order in which the transforms are applied is
 defined by the ObservableList specified in the <a href="#getTransforms()"><code>transforms</code></a> variable.

 <h3>Bounding Rectangles</h3>
 <p>
 Since every <code>Node</code> has transformations, every Node's geometric
 bounding rectangle can be described differently depending on whether
 transformations are accounted for or not.
 <p>
 Each <code>Node</code> has a read-only <a href="#boundsInLocalProperty()"><code>boundsInLocal</code></a>
 variable which specifies the bounding rectangle of the <code>Node</code> in
 untransformed local coordinates. <code>boundsInLocal</code> includes the
 Node's shape geometry, including any space required for a
 non-zero stroke that may fall outside the local position/size variables,
 and its <a href="#clipProperty()"><code>clip</code></a> and <a href="#effectProperty()"><code>effect</code></a> variables.
 <p>
 Each <code>Node</code> also has a read-only <a href="#boundsInParentProperty()"><code>boundsInParent</code></a> variable which
 specifies the bounding rectangle of the <code>Node</code> after all transformations
 have been applied, including those set in <a href="#getTransforms()"><code>transforms</code></a>,
 <a href="#scaleXProperty()"><code>scaleX</code></a>/<a href="#scaleYProperty()"><code>scaleY</code></a>, <a href="#rotateProperty()"><code>rotate</code></a>,
 <a href="#translateXProperty()"><code>translateX</code></a>/<a href="#translateYProperty()"><code>translateY</code></a>, and <a href="#layoutXProperty()"><code>layoutX</code></a>/<a href="#layoutYProperty()"><code>layoutY</code></a>.
 It is called "boundsInParent" because the rectangle will be relative to the
 parent's coordinate system.  This is the 'visual' bounds of the node.
 <p>
 Finally, the <a href="#layoutBoundsProperty()"><code>layoutBounds</code></a> variable defines the rectangular bounds of
 the <code>Node</code> that should be used as the basis for layout calculations and
 may differ from the visual bounds of the node.  For shapes, Text, and ImageView,
 layoutBounds by default includes only the shape geometry, including space required
 for a non-zero <code>strokeWidth</code>, but does <i>not</i> include the effect,
 clip, or any transforms. For resizable classes (Regions and Controls)
 layoutBounds will always map to <code>0,0 width x height</code>.

 <p> The image shows a node without any transformation and its <code>boundsInLocal</code>:
 <p> <img src="doc-files/boundsLocal.png" alt="A sine wave shape enclosed by
 an axis-aligned rectangular bounds"> </p>
 If we rotate the image by 20 degrees we get following result:
 <p> <img src="doc-files/boundsParent.png" alt="An axis-aligned rectangular
 bounds that encloses the shape rotated by 20 degrees"> </p>
 The red rectangle represents <code>boundsInParent</code> in the
 coordinate space of the Node's parent. The <code>boundsInLocal</code> stays the same
 as in the first image, the green rectangle in this image represents <code>boundsInLocal</code>
 in the coordinate space of the Node.

 <p> The images show a filled and stroked rectangle and their bounds. The
 first rectangle <code>[x:10.0 y:10.0 width:100.0 height:100.0 strokeWidth:0]</code>
 has the following bounds bounds: <code>[x:10.0 y:10.0 width:100.0 height:100.0]</code>.

 The second rectangle <code>[x:10.0 y:10.0 width:100.0 height:100.0 strokeWidth:5]</code>
 has the following bounds: <code>[x:7.5 y:7.5 width:105 height:105]</code>
 (the stroke is centered by default, so only half of it is outside
 of the original bounds; it is also possible to create inside or outside
 stroke).

 Since neither of the rectangles has any transformation applied,
 <code>boundsInParent</code> and <code>boundsInLocal</code> are the same. </p>
 <p> <img src="doc-files/bounds.png" alt="The rectangles are enclosed by their
 respective bounds"> </p>


 <h3>CSS</h3>
 <p>
 The <code>Node</code> class contains <code>id</code>, <code>styleClass</code>, and
 <code>style</code> variables that are used in styling this node from
 CSS. The <code>id</code> and <code>styleClass</code> variables are used in
 CSS style sheets to identify nodes to which styles should be
 applied. The <code>style</code> variable contains style properties and
 values that are applied directly to this node.
 <p>
 For further information about CSS and how to apply CSS styles
 to nodes, see the <a href="doc-files/cssref.html">CSS Reference

<div class="block">A performance hint to the system to indicate that this <code>Node</code>

<div class="block">Additional hint for controlling bitmap caching.
 <p>
 Under certain circumstances, such as animating nodes that are very
 expensive to render, it is desirable to be able to perform
 transformations on the node without having to regenerate the cached
 bitmap.  An option in such cases is to perform the transforms on the
 cached bitmap itself.
 <p>
 This technique can provide a dramatic improvement to animation
 performance, though may also result in a reduction in visual quality.
 The <code>cacheHint</code> variable provides a hint to the system about how
 and when that trade-off (visual quality for animation performance) is
 acceptable.
 <p>
 It is possible to enable the cacheHint only at times when your node is
 animating.  In this way, expensive nodes can appear on screen with full
 visual quality, yet still animate smoothly.
 <p>
 Example:
 <pre><code>
        expensiveNode.setCache(true);
        expensiveNode.setCacheHint(CacheHint.QUALITY);
        ...
        // Do an animation
        expensiveNode.setCacheHint(CacheHint.SPEED);
        new Timeline(
            new KeyFrame(Duration.seconds(2),
                new KeyValue(expensiveNode.scaleXProperty(), 2.0),
                new KeyValue(expensiveNode.scaleYProperty(), 2.0),
                new KeyValue(expensiveNode.rotateProperty(), 360),
                new KeyValue(expensiveNode.cacheHintProperty(), CacheHint.QUALITY)
            )
        ).play();
     </code></pre>

 Note that <code>cacheHint</code> is only a hint to the system.  Depending on
 the details of the node or the transform, this hint may be ignored.

 <p>
 If <code>Node.cache</code> is false, cacheHint is ignored.
 Caching may be disabled for any node that has a 3D transform on itself,
 any of its ancestors, or any of its descendants.</div>

 <a href="#translateXProperty()"><code>translateX</code></a>, and <a href="#translateYProperty()"><code>translateY</code></a>

 This is important because layout code must first determine the current
 size and location of the node (using <code>layoutBounds</code>) and then set
 <code>layoutX</code> and <code>layoutY</code> to adjust the translation of the
 node so that it will have the desired layout position.
 <p>
 Because the computation of layoutBounds is often tied to a node's
 geometric variables, it is an error to bind any such variables to an
 expression that depends upon <code>layoutBounds</code>. For example, the
 x or y variables of a shape should never be bound to <code>layoutBounds</code>

<dd>Additional hint for controlling bitmap caching.
 <p>
 Under certain circumstances, such as animating nodes that are very
 expensive to render, it is desirable to be able to perform
 transformations on the node without having to regenerate the cached
 bitmap.  An option in such cases is to perform the transforms on the
 cached bitmap itself.
 <p>
 This technique can provide a dramatic improvement to animation
 performance, though may also result in a reduction in visual quality.
 The <code>cacheHint</code> variable provides a hint to the system about how
 and when that trade-off (visual quality for animation performance) is
 acceptable.
 <p>
 It is possible to enable the cacheHint only at times when your node is
 animating.  In this way, expensive nodes can appear on screen with full
 visual quality, yet still animate smoothly.
 <p>
 Example:
 <pre><code>
        expensiveNode.setCache(true);
        expensiveNode.setCacheHint(CacheHint.QUALITY);
        ...
        // Do an animation
        expensiveNode.setCacheHint(CacheHint.SPEED);
        new Timeline(
            new KeyFrame(Duration.seconds(2),
                new KeyValue(expensiveNode.scaleXProperty(), 2.0),
                new KeyValue(expensiveNode.scaleYProperty(), 2.0),
                new KeyValue(expensiveNode.rotateProperty(), 360),
                new KeyValue(expensiveNode.cacheHintProperty(), CacheHint.QUALITY)
            )
        ).play();

 the details of the node or the transform, this hint may be ignored.

<dd>The rectangular bounds that should be used for layout calculations for

 then the layoutBounds will always be <code>0,0 width x height</code>.
 If the node type is not resizable (<a href="shape/Shape.html" title="class in javafx.scene.shape"><code>Shape</code></a>,
 <a href="text/Text.html" title="class in javafx.scene.text"><code>Text</code></a>, or <a href="Group.html" title="class in javafx.scene"><code>Group</code></a>), then the <code>layoutBounds</code>
 are computed based on the node's geometric properties and does not include the
 node's clip, effect, or transforms.  See individual class documentation
 for details.
 <p>
 Note that the <a href="#layoutXProperty()"><code>layoutX</code></a>, <a href="#layoutYProperty()"><code>layoutY</code></a>,
 <a href="#translateXProperty()"><code>translateX</code></a>, and <a href="#translateYProperty()"><code>translateY</code></a>
 variables are not included in the layoutBounds.
 This is important because layout code must first determine the current
 size and location of the node (using <code>layoutBounds</code>) and then set
 <code>layoutX</code> and <code>layoutY</code> to adjust the translation of the
 node so that it will have the desired layout position.
 <p>
 Because the computation of layoutBounds is often tied to a node's
